# Flask-Blog-App
This is a first attempt at creating a web application using python and flask. The goal is to create a personal finance blog website where I post and talk about differnt stock positions I take and do stock analysis. The blog also has a separate component called Python Stock Analyzer where I created a Dash Application to visualize stock financial data. 
## Moving away from Flask
After starting my new postion as a Junior Web Developer at Syracuse University, I was introduced to the django framework and realized how powerful it was. My new goal is to recreate the backend with Django instead of Flask and make the website public.
